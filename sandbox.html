    <h1>What is Java?</h1>
    <p>Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few
        implementation dependencies as possible. It is a general-purpose programming language intended to let
        application developers write once, run anywhere (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms
        that support Java without the need for recompilation.</p>
